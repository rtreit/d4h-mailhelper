# D4H Mail Helper Extension

This browser extension simplifies the process of sharing D4H links in emails. Originally designed for the Training **Exercises** page, it now works on the Operations tabs such as **Incidents** and **Events**. The extension adds a button to these tables and copies a formatted list of items to your clipboard, ready to be pasted into a new D4H message.

The main functionality is to provide an easy way to generate email-ready links for any of these pages.
